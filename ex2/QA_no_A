Q: What are the three popular strategies for allocating free memory
  blocks to processes in dynamic memory partitioning? Explain briefly
  how each strategy works.

Q: True or False?
   Buddy Strategy always allocates memory in chunks of size power of two and 
   uses a data structure based on a binary tree. 

Q: Give an example drawing of a partially allocated memory and
  appropriate pointers in which each strategy ends up allocating
  a different free memory block to satisfy a memory request for 16 MB. 
  Indicate clearly which strategy allocates which memory block.

Q: What interrupt is created when a desired page frame is not 
   currently resident in RAM?

Q: How does the hardware 'know' that a desired page frame 
   is not currently resident in RAM?

Q: What precisely does it mean if the 'dirty bit' is set for a page frame?

Q: What is 'good' vs. 'bad' program locality?

Q: Explain when/how internal fragmentation may occur.

Q: Explain when/how external fragmentation may occur.

Q: What is a global allocation scheme?

Q: What is a working set model?

Q: Comparing global allocation vs. working set allocation, which would be
   more adversely affected by a program with 'bad' locality? and WHY would
   that be true?

Q: Which one of the following is not among the set of events that may
   take place between the time a page fault occurs and the time the
   faulting process resumes execution?
   (a) OS blocks the process and puts it into a wait queue.
   (b) One of the processes in the ready queue is selected to run. 
   (c) A DMA is initiated to load the page from disk into main memory
   (d) A page replacement strategy is used to find a page frame to
       load the new page
   (e) Page table is updated to reflect the change.
   (f) none of the above

Q: Which one of the following is not among the set of events that may
   take place between the time a page fault occurs and the time the
   faulting process resumes execution?
   (a) OS blocks the process and puts it into a wait queue.
   (b) One of the processes in the ready queue is selected to run. 
   (c) A DMA is initiated to load the page from disk into main memory
   (d) The last page that the faulting process was executing is
       replaced with the newly loaded page.
   (e) Page table is updated to reflect the change.
   (f) none of the above

Q: True or False?
   While DMA (Direct Memory Access) is taking place, processor is free
   to do other things. The processor is only involved at the beginning
   and end of the DMA transfer. 

Q: True or False?
   DMA uses "cycle stealing" to transfer data on the system bus. Each
   time cycle stealing is used, CPU is interrupted.  

   beginning and at the end of DMA (no interrupts in between). 


Q: What is the "largest" program that could execute on a machine with 
   a 24-bit virtual address?


Q: What is the "largest" program that could execute on a machine with 
   a 24-bit physical address?

Q: The address contained in a TLB entry <PTE> is (physical | logical).

Q: List at least 3 flags that are contained in a PTE.

Q: Define hit-ratio in a memory management context.

Q: True or False?
   If a virtual page number X generates a miss in the TLB (Translation
   Lookaside Buffer), then the corresponding physical page number for
   X is guaranteed to be found in the Page Table Entry. 

Q: True or False?
   It is possible that page tables are stored in virtual (secondary) memory.

Q: True or False?
   In a virtual memory system with paging, page size must be large
   enough to offset the high cost of page faults.   

Q: True or False?
   The Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement strategy is based on
   the principle of spatial locality (locality in space) as opposed to
   temporal locality (locality in time).

Q: True or False?
   Consider "clock policy" for page replacement, a newly arrived
   page (i.e. just swapped in) will not get replaced before the clock
   pointer makes two full rotations in the circular buffer of
   candidate page frames.  

Q: True or False?
   In a virtual memory system with paging, you can run a program whose
   size is larger than the size of Main Memory. 

Q: Draw a picture which shows the relationship between ``Virtual Address 
   (virtual page#, offset)'', ``Translation Lookaside Buffer'', ``Page Table'', ``Real
  Address (frame#, offset)'', ``Main Memory'', and ``Secondary Memory''. 

Q: Draw the flowchart for paging using TLB, Page Table, and DMA.

Q: How does the kernel 'know' where on disk the desired 
   information is for a non-resident frame?

Q: Describe what demand paging means.

Q: Describe what prepaging means.
